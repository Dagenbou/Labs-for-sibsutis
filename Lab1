This document explains the way you should write your projects on C++ code

\section{Code}
\lstset{language=c++}
Global environment: connected libraries and global settings are written one after another without blank lines. Then we leave blank line an start writing global variables the same way we did with libraries.

\begin{tabular}{ | l | }
\hline
\begin{lstlisting}
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

const int standartLength=100;
\end{lstlisting}
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Structures, classes and functions, created separately from main function are named this way: first symbol is lower case, if name consists of two or more words, each word after the first starts with upper case symbol. Names of variables of classes and structures must start with m+single underlining.(1)
\begin{tabular}{ | l | }
\hline
\begin{lstlisting}
class citiesOfRussia
{
    int m_member;
};
\end{lstlisting}
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Functions' structure and cycles: symbols, that locate function's, cycles and other forms of executable code blocks, must be placed on separate line from cycle or function to make them more visible. Each new layer of code hierarchy(i.e. for is layer one, it's cycle is layer two) must start with additional indent with size of four(4) spaces or single tabulation. And remember, no magic numbers in functions attributes! Static numbers used in functions must be declared as static value with a name that explains it's usage.

\begin{tabular}{ | l | }
\hline
\begin{lstlisting}
    for(i=0;i<=counter;i++)
    {
        if(i==counter)
        {
            cout << "Complete" << endl;
        }
        else
        {
            cout << i << endl;
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
